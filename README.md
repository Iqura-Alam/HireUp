# HireUp

HireUp is a PostgreSQL-based platform that connects job seekers, employers, and trainers. 
The system matches candidates to jobs based on their skills, recommends courses to fill skill gaps, 
and helps employers manage job postings and applications. Trainers can publish courses, track 
enrollments, and issue certificates.

The project highlights strong database design using PostgreSQL with tables, relationships, stored 
procedures, triggers, functions, views, and indexing. Entities include User, Candidate, Employer, 
Trainer, Job, Application, Course, and Skill.

In short, HireUp is a complete, database-driven recruitment and skill-development system built 
to demonstrate real-world relational database design and advanced SQL features.
